However, most of these corpora are exclusively for English. As the pandemic is a global problem, it is worth creating COVID-19 related datasets for languages other than English. In this paper, we present the first manuallyannotated COVID-19 domain-specific dataset for Vietnamese. Particularly, our dataset is annotated for the named entity recognition (NER) task with newly-defined entity types that can be used in other future epidemics. Our dataset also contains the largest number of entities compared to existing Vietnamese NER datasets. We empirically conduct experiments using strong baselines on our dataset, and find that: automatic Vietnamese word segmentation helps improve the NER results and the highest performances are obtained by finetuning pre-trained language models where the monolingual model PhoBERT for Vietnamese (Nguyen and Nguyen, 2020) produces higher results than the multilingual model XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020).

This attack technique has become a challenge for information security systems of organizations, governments, and businesses. The approaches of using machine learning or deep learning algorithms to analyze signs and abnormal behaviors of network traffic for detecting and preventing APT attacks have become popular in recent years. However, the APT attack detection approach that uses behavior analysis and evaluation techniques is facing many difficulties due to the lack of typical data of attack campaigns. To handle this situation, recent studies have selected and extracted the APT attack behaviors which based on datasets are built from experimental tools. Consequently, these properties are few and difficult to obtain in practical monitoring systems. Therefore, although the experimental results show good detection, it does not bring high efficiency in practice. For above reasons, in this paper, a new method based on network traffic analysis using a combined deep learning model to detect APT attacks will be proposed. Specifically, individual deep learning networks such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), cnvolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) will also be sought, built and linked into combined deep learning networks to analyze and detect signs of APT attacks in network traffic. To detect APT attack signals, the combined deep learning models are performed in two main stages including (i) extracting IP features based on flow: In this phase, we will analyze network traffic into networking flows by IP address and then use the combined deep learning models to extract IP features by network flow; (ii) classifying APT attack IPs: Based on IP features extracted in a task (i), the APT attack IPs and normal IPs will be identified and classified. The proposal of a combined deep learning model to detect APT attacks based on network traffic is a new approach, and there is no research proposed and applied yet. In the experimental section, combined deep learning models proved their superior abilities to ensure accuracy on all measurements from 93 to 98%. This is a very good result for APT attack detection based on network traffic.","tags":["APT Attack Detection","Network Traffic","Abnormal Behavior","Combined Deep Learning Model"],"title":"A novel approach for APT attack detection based on combined deep learning model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anh Tuan Nguyen","Mai Hoang Dao","Dat Quoc Nguyen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604188800,"objectID":"b3097097d85848fb32f500f754dba046","permalink":"https://maihoangdao.github.io/publication/6/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/6/","section":"publication","summary":"Semantic parsing is an important NLP task.

This attack technique is growing in both the number of recorded attacks and the extent of its dangers to organizations, businesses and governments. Therefore, the task of detecting and warning APT attacks in the real system is very necessary today. One of the most effective approaches to APT attack detection is to apply machine learning or deep learning to analyze network traffic. There have been a number of studies and recommendations to analyze network traffic into network flows and then combine with some classification or clustering methods to look for signs of APT attacks. In particular, recent studies often apply machine learning algorithms to spot the present of APT attacks based on network flow. In this paper, a new method based on deep learning to detect APT attacks using network flow is proposed. Accordingly, in our research, network traffic is analyzed into IP-based network flows, then the IP information is reconstructed from flow, and finally deep learning models are used to extract features for detecting APT attack IPs from other IPs. Additionally, a combined deep learning model using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is introduced. The new detection model is evaluated and compared with some traditional machine learning models, i.e. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and single GCN models, in the experiments. Experimental results show that BiLSTM-GCN model has the best performance in all evaluation scores. This not only shows that deep learning application on flow network analysis to detect APT attacks is a good decision but also suggests a new direction for network intrusion detection techniques based on deep learning.","tags":["Advanced Persistent Threat","APT Attack Detection","Network Traffic","Bidirectional Long-short Term Memory","Graph Convolutional Networks"],"title":"APT attack detection based on flow network analysis techniques using deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiayuan He","Dat Quoc Nguyen","Saber A.

The information about the new discoveries are usually disclosed in scientific literature and in particular, in chemical patents, since patents are often the first venues where the new chemical compounds are publicized. Despite the significance of the information provided in chemical patents, extracting the information from patents is costly due to the large volume of existing patents and its drastic expansion rate. The Cheminformatics Elsevier Melbourne University (ChEMU) evaluation lab 2020, part of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum 2020 (CLEF2020), provides a platform to advance the state-of-the-arts in automatic information extraction systems over chemical patents. In particular, we focus on extracting synthesis process of new chemical compounds from chemical patents. Using the ChEMU corpus of 1500 “snippets” (text segments) sampled from 170 patent documents and annotated by chemical experts, we defined two key information extraction tasks. Task 1 targets at chemical named entity recognition, i.e., the identification of chemical compounds and their specific roles in chemical reactions. Task 2 targets at event extraction, i.e., the identification of reaction steps, relating the chemical compounds involved in a chemical reaction. In this paper, we provide an overview of our ChEMU2020 lab. Herein, we describe the resources created for the two tasks, the evaluation methodology adopted, and participants results. We also provide a brief summary of the methods employed by participants of this lab and the results obtained across 46 runs from 11 teams, finding that several submissions achieve substantially better results than the baseline methods prepared by the organizers.","tags":["Named Entity Recognition","Event Extraction","Information Extraction","Chemical Reactions"],"title":"An Extended Overview of the CLEF 2020 ChEMU Lab: Information Extraction of Chemical Reactions from Patents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mai Hoang Dao","Dat Quoc Nguyen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"0dd5b0ac39124b270654ab011a52f7d9","permalink":"https://maihoangdao.github.io/publication/3/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/3/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper describes our VinAI system for the ChEMU task 1 of named entity recognition (NER) in chemical reactions.

In a post-evaluation phase, fixing a mapping bug which converts the column-based format into the brat standoff format helps our system to obtain higher results. In particular, we obtain an exact-match F1 score at 95.21% and especially a relaxed-match F1 score at 97.26%, thus achieving the highest relaxed-match F1 compared to all other participating systems.
